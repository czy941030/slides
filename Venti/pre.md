# Overview

## Abstract

### Abstract
- Venti: A network storage system intended for archival data
- A building block for a variety of storage applications
	1) logical backup
	2) physical backup
	3) snapshot file systems
- A block is identified by a unique hash of it's contents
- Enforce a write-once policy
- Duplicate copies of a block can be coalesced

## Background

### Archival Storage

- Purpose
	- Store data for long periods of time (forever)
	- Data may not be needed frequently, but when it is needed it is often crucial

### Prevalent Form

- Tape backup
	- Backup data to magnetic tape
	- (tar, ufsdump...)
	- Full backup vs Incremental backup
	- To provide backup as a central service for a number of client machines

### Prevalent Form

- Snapshot
	- A snapshot is a consistent read-only view of the file system at some point in the past.
	- Each snapshot is a complete file system tree, much like a full backup.
	- A snapshot only requires additional storage for the blocks that have changed, like a incremental backup.
	- Always available and easy to access
	- Plan 9, WAFL, AFS...

## Venti

### Venti Archival Storage
- Goal: To provide a write-once archival reponsitory than can be shared by mutiple client machines and applications.
- Block level network storage system
	+ Actually a backend storage for client apps
- Blocks addressed by hash of their contents
	+ Use SHA-1 algorithm
	+ Use hash value as its unique 'fingerprint'
- Write-Once policy
	+ Block once written, never modified
	+ Modified blocks will have new address

### Why SHA-1?
- SHA-1 hash function is developed by NIST
- Output 160 bit hash values(20 bytes)
- Probability that there will be one or more collisions:
\begin{displaymath}
p \leq{} \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \times{} \frac{1}{2^b}
\end{displaymath}
- Consider a large storage system contains $10^{18}$ byte of data stored as 8 Kbyte blocks($\sim{}10^{14}$ blocks), the probability is less then $10^{-20}$.
- Variants of SHA-1 can produce 256, 384 and 512 bit results for future use.

### Venti Archival Storage
- Multiple clients can Share a Venti server
	+ Hash function gives an unversal namespace
	+ Duplication increases the utility rate of space
- Inherent integrity checking for data
- Caching is simplified
- Uses magnetic disk as storage technology
	+ Access time comparable to non-archival data

# Data Organization

### Data Organization
- Data is divided into blocks and written to the server
- Pack the fingerprints into additional blocks, called pointer blocks, that are also written to the server
- Until a single fingerprint is obtained
- Applications can use such a structure to store a single file or to mimic the behavior of a physical device such as a tape or a disk drive

### Data Organization
- Venti does not allow such a tree to be modified
- But new versions of the tree can be generated efficiently by storing the new or modified data blocks and reusing the unchanged sections
- By mixing data and fingerprints in a block, more complex data structures can be constructed.
- For example, a structure for storing a file system may include three types of blocks: 
	+ Directory
	+ Pointer 
	+ Data.

# Application Example

\subsection{Vac}

### Vac
- Vac is an application similar to tar and zip
	+ With vac, Selected files will be stored as \newline{} a tree of blocks on Venti server.
	+ The output is always 45 bytes long,\newline{} included a 20 byte root fingerprint.
	+ 'unvac' enables user to estore files from a vac archive.
- Vac writes each file as a seperated collection of Venti blocks, which can coalesce duplicate copies of a file
- Incremental backups options can improve performance

\subsection[Phy Bak]{Physical Backup}

### Physical Backup
- Vac archive data at the file or logical level
- Alternative approach: block-level or physical backup
- Copy the raw contents of disk drives to Venti
- Coalescing duplicate blocks is the main advantage
- Can even mount a backup file system image from Venti
- Full restore can be done in a lazy fashing

\subsection[Plan 9]{Plan 9 File System}

### Plan 9 File System
- When combined with a small amount of read/write storage, Venti can be used as the primary location for data
- Plan 9 file system store snapshot on optical jukebox
- magnetic disks act as a cache for the jukebox
- New version of the Plan 9 file system uses Venti instead of an optical jukebox as its storage device

# Implementation

### Implementation

### Implementation
- For data block
	+ Use Append-only log
	+ Blocks store on a RAIDÔºç5 array of IDE disk drives
- For Index
	+ Using a disk-resident hash table
	+ Index is diveided into fixed-size buckets
	+ Index store on 8 SCSI drives
- Additional work
	+ caching, striping, write buffering

# Conclusion

### Conclusion
- Approach of identifying a block by SHA-1 hash is a well suited to archival storage
- Write-once policy of a block and ability to coalesce duplicate copies of a block makes Venti a useful building block for many interesting storage application
- By rapid groth in capacity of magnetic disks, it seems unlikely that archival data will be deleted to reclaim space
